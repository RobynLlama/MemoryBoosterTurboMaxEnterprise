# Memory Booster Turbo Max Enterprise

Congratulations on redeeming your *Enterprise License* for this premium Robyn Software Incorporated product!

Memory Booster Turbo Max (Enterprise Edition) supercharges your Ostranauts experience by aggressively forcing garbage collection every time you save your game.

## Customer Appreciation Program

Your **Enterprise License** comes with a free gift! Please find enclosed a buy 2 get 1 half off [coupon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) for any Trenchers brand vacuum-sealed meal pouch!

## What does that even mean?

You might notice a slight extra second or two while saving, don't worry, that’s just your RAM getting a well-deserved workout. Ideally, this means the game uses less memory overall, so you can keep scrapping those wrecks without encountering the most deadly enemy in the solar system: slowdown.

## Does it actually work?

If you have a top-of-the-line PC with a reasonable amount of RAM, probably not. This is mostly for those of us living on the edge, pushing memory limits, and craving every byte of optimization.

## Disclaimer

Robyn Software Incorporated is not responsible for any unexpected performance spikes, mysterious memory surges, or the sudden urge to buy more RAM. Use at your own risk!

Robyn Software Incorporated and all its subsidiaries vehemently deny that any corporate shareholders have engaged in dealings with sentient meat.
